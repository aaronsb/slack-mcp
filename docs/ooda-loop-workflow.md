# OODA Loop Workflow & Semantic Flow

This document describes how the Slack MCP Server implements the OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) loop pattern for intelligent workspace interaction, including detailed flow diagrams and user personality interactions.

## Overview

The OODA loop creates a continuous cycle of awareness and response:
- **Observe**: Gather information about the workspace state
- **Orient**: Understand context and analyze what's important
- **Decide**: Plan appropriate actions based on context
- **Act**: Execute responses and monitor results

## User Personality & Semantic Flow

The server implements "self-deprecating tools" that guide users toward better alternatives. Each tool provides semantic suggestions for the next logical action, creating a natural workflow while allowing creative flexibility.

    Start[Morning Check-in] --> Unreads[check-unreads]
    Unreads --> Count{Message Count?}
    
    Count -->|1-3 msgs| FullRead[Read full content<br/>Auto-mark read]
    Count -->|4-15 msgs| UrgencyRead[Read with urgency<br/>Auto-mark read]
    Count -->|16-50 msgs| Summary[Summary only<br/>Keep unread]

    Decide --> Response{Response needed?}
    Response -->|Yes| Pace[pace-conversation]
    Response -->|No| NextChannel[Next unread channel]
    
    Pace --> Timing{Conversation timing?}
    Timing -->|Active < 30s| QuickReply[write-message]
    Timing -->|Slowing > 30s| WaitReact[Wait for response]
    
    QuickReply --> Monitor[catch-up-on-channel]
    NextChannel --> Unreads

    style Count fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Timing fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Example 2: Topic Search (Creative Flow)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Query[Find API discussion] --> Search[find-discussion query='API redesign']
    Search --> Results{Found threads?}
    
    Results -->|Yes| Context[catch-up-on-channel<br/>for each thread channel]
    Results -->|No| Broader[Broaden search terms]
    
    Context --> Analyze[Read thread context]
    Analyze --> Contribute{Can contribute?}
    
    Contribute -->|Yes| Write[write-message threadTs='xxx']
    Contribute -->|No| Mark[mark-as-read channel='xxx']
    
    Write --> WaitResponse[pace-conversation]
    WaitResponse --> CheckNew[find-discussion threadId='xxx']
    
    style Query fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style Results fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Conversation Pacing States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ActiveEngaged: < 10s
    ActiveEngaged --> EngagedThoughtful: 10-30s
    EngagedThoughtful --> Transitioning: 30-60s
    Transitioning --> ReactiveWaiting: 1-5m
    ReactiveWaiting --> Dormant: > 5m
    
    ActiveEngaged: Quick responses expected
    EngagedThoughtful: Thoughtful pace OK
    Transitioning: Consider waiting
    ReactiveWaiting: Wait for them
    Dormant: Move to other tasks
    
    ActiveEngaged --> ActiveEngaged: New message
    EngagedThoughtful --> ActiveEngaged: Their reply
    Transitioning --> ActiveEngaged: Re-engagement
    ReactiveWaiting --> ActiveEngaged: They return
    Dormant --> ActiveEngaged: Reactivation
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Self-Deprecating Tools
Tools recommend better alternatives when available:
- `decide-next-action` ‚Üí suggests specialized reasoning tools
- Basic tools ‚Üí suggest semantic workflows
- Fallback options ‚Üí promote optimal paths

### 2. Count-Based Message Windowing
Intelligent content display based on volume:
- **1-3 messages**: Full consumption = auto-mark read
- **4-15 messages**: Thorough review = auto-mark read
- **16-50 messages**: Triage only = preserve unread
- **50+ messages**: Surface scan = preserve unread

### 3. Non-Blocking Conversation Pacing
Using thinking time instead of delays:
```
pace-conversation ‚Üí "Think about: [focus]" ‚Üí Natural pause
```

### 4. Two-Phase Channel Caching
Fast startup with progressive loading:
1. **Phase 1**: Member channels (immediate)
2. **Phase 2**: All workspace channels (background)

## Implementation Notes

### Channel Security
- Channel IDs never exposed to AI
- All resolution through cached mappings
- Names used in all tool interfaces

### Semantic Continuity
Each tool provides `nextActions` with pre-filled parameters:
```json
{
  "nextActions": [
    "catch-up-on-channel channel='general' since='1h'",
    "find-discussion threadId='C123:456.789'",
    "write-message channel='general' threadTs='456.789'"
  ]
}
```

### Error Recovery
- Cache misses trigger API fallback
- Rate limits handled with backoff
- Stale cache detection and refresh

## Workflow Customization

Agents can customize their approach:

1. **Efficiency Mode**: Skip decide phase, direct tool chains
2. **Thorough Mode**: Full OODA cycle for every interaction  
3. **Monitor Mode**: Observe-Orient loop without acting
4. **Batch Mode**: Process multiple channels before acting

The semantic flow supports all modes while gently guiding toward optimal patterns.
